# Doc741 Introduction

## What exactly is Doc741?
It is a comprehensive and complete documentation for the Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager (BSPWM).
BSPWM (I will use lowercase from hereon..)  is a tiling window manager which uses binary space partition system. (C students must have known what it means). Unlike other dynamic window managers like dwm and awesomewm, bspwm is what you configure and use. It is possible to do anything with correct integration of configs : bspwm + sxhkd + eww or polybar, you will get a perfectly aligned environment that obeys your thoughts. I named this documentation as doc741 because it is short and aligns with documentation policy of my interest.

## Why did I create this documentation?

**Reason 1 :** There has not been enough documentation on bspwm as far I have surfed the web.
**Reason 2 :** I want to create an ideal bspwm working environment using all the commands that ever existed in bspwm to create a sophisticated working environment that I like.
**Reason 3** : As a part of open source contribution, which can be used by my friends.
